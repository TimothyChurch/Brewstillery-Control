# Brewstillery-Control

This is the first phase of software for controlling every aspect of a Brewstillery. The current project is focus on automating certain aspects of running a coolant management plated still. 

The plan is to design a base software to put on each controller throughout the brewstillery. Each could be assigned their individual job using that portion of the software. Each of these can be access remotely but also pass all their data back to a centralize source for storage. 

If there are any feature requests or thoughts, please let me know! I'm enjoying diving into this and want to make is capable of doing anything we can think up!
